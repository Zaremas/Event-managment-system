Hello, welcome to my task!
The topic is: event managment system

You can start it using "docker-compose up"
if that doesn't work(my first time creating a docker), then this project just needs a mongodb active on port 27017 and in terminal 
npm install
npm start

also you can use 
npm run dev
instead, to run it with nodemon(automatically restarts if something changes)

in this project i have main page with all the events, register, login and logout functions.
And functions to register for an event and create an event(only available for admin)

For this project I used Node.js and express for backend, ejs for template pages and css for frontend. It may be obvious but i hsve considerably more experience with backend. 
Have nice day!
